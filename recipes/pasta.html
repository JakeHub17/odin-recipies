  <h2>Ingridients:</h2>
  <ul>
  <p>
    <li><strong>Shrimp</strong>
    Choose large shrimp (31 to 35 shrimp per pound) to get best results for this recipe. You can buy <em>fresh shrimp</em> and peel and devein it yourself, or buy <em>frozen shrimp.</em> Thaw frozen shrimp before using.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Pasta</strong>
    This recipe uses a 16-ounce package of linguine, but you can substitute the pasta of your choice, like angel hair pasta, fettuccine, or spaghetti.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Butter</strong>
    Use unsalted butter. You can add salt to taste later in the recipe.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil</strong>
    The flavor of the olive oil comes through in this recipe, so use the best quality.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Shallots and garlic</strong>
    These aromatics add flavor and fragrance to shrimp scampi.</li>
    
   <li><strong>White wine</strong>
    Use a dry, crisp white wine for shrimp scampi sauce. Pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc are good choices, and you can drink the leftover wine with dinner.</li>
    
   <li><strong>Lemon juice</strong>
    Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.</li>
